fawkes_lua: Fawkes Lua code for ROS
===================================

This package provides the Lua utility classes taken from the Fawkes source
tree. The goal of this package is to allow for a free flow of this Lua code
between Fawkes and ROS without the need for platform-specific changes on
code transfer. Keep this in mind when changing these files.

Requirements
------------
The package contains rather generic Lua code and has no specific requirements.

Documentation
-------------
Documentation has been generated using luadoc and is available in the doc
subdirectory.
